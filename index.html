                High-throughput genomic studies, longitudinal cohort tracking, and translational neuroscience continue to refine how inherited variants, <em>de novo</em> changes, and environmental exposures intersect to shape outcomes.

                  <p>
                    Research links ASD to hundreds of gene variants that influence brain development and synaptic function. Both inherited variants and <em>de novo</em> changes contribute to risk, often interacting across multiple genes.

                    ASD tends to run in families. Siblings and twins show higher concordance rates, indicating a strong heritable component even when no single gene fully explains the condition.

          <h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h2>
          <p>
            ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that influences communication, social interaction, and behavior. Early identification and supportive interventions help individuals maximize strengths and independence.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Points</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Diagnosis uses DSM-5-TR criteria via multidisciplinary evaluations.</li>
            <li>Genetic variations are the primary contributors; vaccines do not cause autism.</li>
            <li>Supports include educational programs, therapies, and family coaching.</li>
            <li>Community connections reduce barriers and foster inclusion.</li>
          </ul>
